# HTML and Git Practice
This project is my first step into web development and version control. I am creating simple HTML pages and managing the project with Git and GitHub.

By the end of this project I will have:

- set up a GitHub repository and worked with Git
- written clear and meaningful commit messages
- created basic HTML pages and used the core features of the HTML language
